🌸 Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset

🎯 Objective
To understand the structure and distribution of the Iris dataset by performing data inspection, statistical analysis, and visualization.

📊 Dataset
Name: Iris Dataset
Source: Built-in with seaborn (sns.load_dataset("iris"))
Features: sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width
Target: species
🛠️ Steps Performed
Loaded dataset using pandas.
Displayed shape, column names, and first few rows.
Used .info() and .describe() for summary statistics.
Visualized data using:
📈 Scatter plots (pairplots) for feature relationships
📊 Histograms for value distributions
📦 Box plots for outlier detection
🔍 Final Observations
Petal length and petal width clearly distinguish species.
Sepal measurements show more overlap between species.
Setosa species has lower values overall; no major outliers seen in this class.
A few potential outliers appear in sepal width.
💻 Tools Used
Jupyter Notebook
Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
