# 🏠 Task 6: House Price Prediction

## 📌 Objective
Predict house prices based on various features such as:
- Area (square feet)
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Number of stories
- Whether the house has amenities like basement, hot water, guestroom, etc.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- Dataset used: `Housing.csv` from Kaggle  
- Includes features like:  
  `area`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `stories`, `mainroad`, `guestroom`, `basement`, `hotwaterheating`, `airconditioning`, `parking`, `prefarea`, `furnishingstatus`, `price`

---

## 🛠️ Tasks Performed
- ✅ Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
- ✅ Categorical Encoding (One-Hot Encoding)  
- ✅ Feature Scaling (StandardScaler)  
- ✅ Train-Test Split  
- ✅ Regression Modeling (Linear Regression & Gradient Boosting)  
- ✅ Evaluation using:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- ✅ Prediction vs Actual Price Visualization

---

## 📊 Visualizations
- Regression scatter plots
- Actual vs Predicted bar plots

---

## 🔍 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
